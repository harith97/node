### Node hello world
This is a simple Hello world webserver written in node. It will respond to "GET /" requests with the text "Hello World!". This is made using express.
It will use the default port provided by Railway, or 3000 if it isn't set.
Once the template is used to create a project, it will automatically start without extra configuration required.
